# spotify-mpd

An MPD server implementation for Spotify using [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot).
Created with the motivation to not be confined to Spotify's resource heavy desktop application and instead be able to use my preferred MPD client.

### Prerequisites

* Rust
* A Spotify Premium account

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
